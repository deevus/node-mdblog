# pagan

pagination of arrays with ease

## well, hello there.

you're probably wondering what the purpose of this library is.

simply put, it's aim is to provide you with an encapsulated array class to paginate whatever you see fit.

ofcourse this is limited to arrays, but you can see from the examples what i mean.

## npm for the win

```bash
npm install pagan
```

## a short example

```javascript
var pagan = require('pagan');
var arr = new pagan();

'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'.split(' ').map(function(q) {
  arr.push(q);
  return q;
});

arr.setPage(process.argv[2] || 1);
arr.setIncrement(process.argv[3] || 3);

console.log(arr.values());
```

## run it

```bash
    node a_short_example.js
    #-> [ 'the', 'quick', 'brown' ]
```
