title: Tintin and Lorem ipsum
---
I was re-watching Herg&eacute;'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin_(TV_series)" title="Wikipedia: The Adventures of Tintin"><em>The Adventures of Tintin</em></a> a while back and noticed the animators set the bodies of the newspapers in Lorem ipsum as filler text. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintin_and_Snowy" title="Wikipedia: Tintin and Snowy">Tintin and Snowie</a> being favourite heroes of my childhood this brought a little smile to my face.

<p class="note"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_Ipsum" title="Wikipedia: Lorem ipsum">Lorem ispum</a> is a placeholder or filler text used in typography, design and other publishing as means of testing the visual representation. Lorem ipsum features roughly the same letter distribution as in English.</p>
