title: GUADEC 2008, Istanbul
---
This marks the first journal entry from Istanbul! I've been here in Turkey for the past week attending <acronym title="GNOME users&rsquo; and developers&rsquo; European conference">GUADEC</acronym>, which for the whole part has been a blast. It's as community-focused as <acronym title="Linux.conf.au">LCA</acronym>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the largest free software conference in the southern hemisphere&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and thus a whole heap of fun.

<p class="note"><acronym title="GNOME users&rsquo; and developers&rsquo; European conference">GUADEC</acronym> is the premier <acronym title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</acronym> conference, held in a different European city every year, where developers and users alike chat about <acronym title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</acronym> and generally party a lot. <acronym title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</acronym> is a free desktop environment built on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtk%2B" title="Wikipedia: GTK+"><abbr>GTK+</abbr></a> toolkit.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>

* Meeting Hylke Bons (hbons), Andreas Nilson (andreasn) and Kalle Persson (kallepersson) for the first time face-to-face&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we've known each other for a good year through the Tango Desktop Project&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;it's great putting a face to an <acronym title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</acronym> nick;
* Catching up and having dinner with a different group of like-minded, awesome and friendly people every night at various restaurants on the Bosphorus;
* The three-hour boat party sponsored by <a href="http://www.collabora.co.uk/" title="Collabora homepage">Collabora</a> on Thursday evening;
* Federico Mena-Quintero's talk on document-centric <acronym title="GNU Network Object Model Environment">GNOME</acronym> where he proposed a journal-based history application&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;although I disagree with the implementation it caused quite a buzz and got the ideas flowing;
* Catching up with <a href="http://0pointer.de/lennart/" title="Lennart Poettering&rsquo;s personal site">Lennart Poettering</a> and watching him haggling and forcing taxi drivers to bid each other down;
* Post-<acronym title="GNOME users&rsquo; and developers&rsquo; European conference">GUADEC</acronym> dinner under Lefty's guidance at a Japanese restaurant followed by a water-pipe smoking session whilst sipping apple tea in a back-alley caf&eacute; in Taxim.

I fly out on Monday before heading to London for <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/UK2008/" title="LugRadio Live UK 2008 website">LugRadio Live</a> with a day in between back in Frankfurt to rest and recover. Between doors until the 24<sup>th</sup>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;ought to be good fun!

On a final note, the <a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/" title="Tango Desktop Project homepage">Tango Desktop Project icons</a> have been re-licensed into the public domain. I'll do a proper writeup in the coming days on the implications and what this means for developers and artists.
