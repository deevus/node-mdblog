title: Neglecting web typography
published: false

It is astounding to think that text, which still makes up most of the content on the web (perhaps not in bytes, but in quantity), is the most neglected in regards of visual appearance. We may pick a 'cool' font and colour perhaps, but before long we focus back to other things. This is perfectly natural as distributed, relatively inexpensive computing democratizes the setting of the digital word into an accessible, daily event and those who do it most care the least how their desired character is generated or how the final glyph is styled.

Web designers however don't have this excuse and yet we've long overlooked typography in our designs. It is oft spuriously seen as a gray-haired austere discipline that limits the creativity and whose dry classical rules are boring to learn.

<blockquote cite="Fred Smeijers">
    <p>There is a stupid tendency in design to make everything funny, to avoid trouble and effort, to escape from 	traditional views just because they set guidelines (seen as obstacles), and to neglect responsibilities. And all this is only because of the misunderstanding that any &#8216;applied art&#8217; cannot be really creative or new or highly conceptual. So the most mundane things are overdone, made up, with unnecessary and thus unclear concepts. Against all this nonsense, it becomes necessary to spell out the responsibilities which our creative talents have to meet. Do the job, as well as you can. Get on with it and keep quiet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fred Smeijers is on the mark. As web designers we have a large array of responsibilities: we need to concern ourselves with accessibility, usability, cultural sensitivity, and more. Typography is vital because it encompasses many of these&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a case in point, legibility is vital to many facets of a good website and user experience.</p>

<p>But what is typography exactly and how does it apply to the web? Typography can be considered the art of creating and setting type with the purpose of honoring the text it sets. It can indeed be considered an applied art, with elementary principles that can be taught and learned. The first printing manuals that broke the tradition of the print master&ndash;apprentice relationship conveyed the knowledge of movable type to the privileged literate classes. These books didn&#8217;t contain much in stylistic advice, primarily because the stylistic aspects of the technology were accepted as given. It wasn&#8217;t until the age of enlightenment that typography thrived as printers&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;there was no real distinction between a type designer and a printer yet&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;experimented with humanistic styles in an attempt to move away from the heavy gothic blackletter with which Gutenberg printed the first Latin books.</p>

<p>Typography offers many opportunities for stylistic variation though&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;not unlike other applied arts&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;what might appear simply to &#8216;look good&#8217; often has applied reasoning behind it. Abbreviations set in small capitals within running bodies of text are easier to read because they are at the same x-height (the height of the baseline to the mean line, essentially the height of a lowercase letter x) as the minuscules (lower case letters) and thus are less prone to disturb and stand out from the surrounding letters, words, and sentences. More generally, simple elements like size, colour (typographic colour: the contrast between the shapes of the letters and their background, their whitespace), and measure (length of the line) directly correlate with the number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" title="Wikipedia (English): Saccade">saccades</a> the eye makes while reading, and thus the legibility of a piece of text. These correlations are the foundation of these principles.</p>

<span class="calloutRight">Typography can bring aesthetic order to in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion, helping users read <span class="amp">&amp;</span> navigate.</span>
<p>When moving across mediums, classical definitions often need to be adapted somewhat to match the limitations of new mediums. The containing medium has and will continue to determine what is feasible, what isn&#8217;t, and influence the creation and adaption of stylistic conventions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incunabulum" title="Wikipedia (English): Incunabulum">Incunabulum</a> featured little leading (vertical space between lines) to conserve line space and rarely if ever more than one typeface. Further, documents created with a typewriter are set in a monospaced face because the metal typebars are all equidistant to the paper and were less likely jam than a proportionally-spaced typeface which would have been much more difficult to engineer. The advent of the digital technologies and the web in particular have provided a new canvas to enfold the written word and offer with it a range of opportunities as well as challenges that were previously unimagined. Because the nature of the written word itself has changed little, most of the principles that were considered stylistic etiquette back in the days when letterpress printing was the new thing can still be applied to setting type on the web today.</p>

Observing these 'classical rules' will help bring graceful order to information and aid users in their quest of finding what they're looking for. Consider the rules as useful guidelines. They help avoid mistakes and while they could conversely prevent inventive divergences into deviant territory, I encourage you to understand them before breaking them.

### Starting out: reset

#### A note on reset stylesheets

<p>One of the biggest headaches in the realm of web design is achieving rendering consistency in <acronym title="User Agent">UA</acronym>s (user agents; web browsers essentially), something web typography is not exempt from. The prime reason for this&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;besides <acronym title="User Agent">UA</acronym> quirks and varying rendering technologies&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;is the default styling for <acronym title="eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> elements that <acronym title="User Agent">UA</acronym>s set. These exist to provide a minimum readable experience when displaying a page that lacks any accompanying <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> and vary from <acronym title="User Agent">UA</acronym> to <acronym title="User Agent">UA</acronym> because the <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">w3c</acronym> did not want to mandate any specific styling of <acronym title="eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> elements. The fix is quite simple: &#8216;resetting&#8217; (redefining) the elements by employing a <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> &#8216;reset style sheet&#8217;. There are numerous reset sheets available and probably an even greater number of <a href="http://klepas.org/2008/04/26/are-reset-stylesheets-bad/" title="klepas.org: Are reset style sheets bad?">views on the subject</a>. With the choice of redefining all the elements <acronym title="eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> offers it&#8217;s easy go overboard and on top of that, inadvertently remove critical accessibility functionality, neglecting to re-implement it later. A common example of this is <a href="http://webaim.org/blog/plague-of-outline-0/" title="webaim.org: Plague of outline: 0">setting the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> outline property to zero</a>, removing the visual indication of which anchor is currently in the keyboard focus, drastically reducing keyboard accessibility. File size and latency have in the past also been a raised concern though generally considered debunked&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;reset sheets can decrease the overall size of the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> by providing a clean slate off the bat that removes the need for extensive styling later on.</p>

##### Butterfly-kicking down doors since 1958

<p>Both the <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/" title="Blueprint CSS framework">Blueprint <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> framework</a> and the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/" title="Yahoo! UI Library: Reset CSS">Yahoo! User Interface Library</a> (<acronym title="Yahoo! User Interface">YUI</acronym> library) feature reset sheets&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the former of which is based on <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/" title="meyerweb.com: CSS Tools: Reset CSS">Eric Meyer&#8217;s own reset sheet</a>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and there are bound to be many others along with various cross-breeds. The benefit of using one of the three particular style sheets above is that they&#8217;ve been tested and used extensively. Scores of talented developers have examined the intricacies of each property and its definition, what it &#8216;resets&#8217; and why, allowing you to just stick it into the top of your <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> file or link it as a separate style sheet. An interesting exercise to try is keeping the reset sheet separate, removing it once the project is complete just as an indication of the differences it can make when the given website is viewed in a number of varying <acronym title="User Agent">UA</acronym>s<sup>1</sup>.</p>

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
2. Aliquam tincidunt mauris eu risus.
3. Vestibulum auctor dapibus neque.

<p>Ultimately, as with many things, it comes down to balance&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;balance the need for a full reset sheet over how much and how complex the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> styling will be, keeping in mind future expansion and development of the web site. You want to avoid excessive redundant styling where possible. Finally, and most importantly: when copying from an existing reset sheet make sure you understand what you are redefining with it; never copy and paste blindly.</p>
