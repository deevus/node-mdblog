title: Logo branding on device icons
---
The <a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/" title="Tango Desktop Project on freedesktop.org">Tango</a> policy on depicting trademarks and logos in icons is to generally remove branding such they are freely distributable (obviously to avoid trademark violations or the like). Thus Sony became 'Pony' and so on... and on that note, just the other day the following arose:

<span class="calloutRight"><img src="/files/images/apple-imac-lamp.png" alt="apple-imac-lamp icon illustrating a deviance from the Apple logo." title="apple-imac-lamp" width="250" height="250" /></span>

<blockquote>
    <p>Any idea on how (or by what) I could replace logos from strongly &ldquo;branded&rdquo; devices (such as Apple&rsquo;s)? A trick like Sony &rarr; Pony is easily doable for texts. But it&rsquo;s much harder for logos that are somehow part of the look of the device&hellip; Any advice on that would be very much appreciated.</p>

    <p>Well how about replacing the apple with an orange, putting the bite mark on the other side?</p>
