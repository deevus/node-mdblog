title: BarCampCanberra1 wrap-up
---
Over a year ago four of us&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;<a href="http://onblogging.com.au/">Andrew Boyd</a>, <a href="">Nathanael Boehm</a>, <a href="http://www.acidlabs.org/">Stephen Collins</a> and myself&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;sat around a caf&eacute; here in Woden, Canberra discussing the logistics of running Canberra's first BarCamp.

Two days ago, April 19<sup>th</sup> we finally ended up kicking off BarCampCanberra1, here at the <acronym title="Australian National University">ANU</acronym>. With over sixty people we had three streams going throughout the day offering a large range of topics, social networking and even towards the end a White Wolf Werewolf <acronym title="Role Playing Game">RPG</acronym> session.

I also had to chance to present the first version of my talk on typography&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/klepas/beautiful-web-typography-5" title="Slideshare: Beautiful Web Typography"><em>Beautiful Web Typography</em></a> (edit: updated link to most recent version). I was very pleased with the reception and especially happy to see new users of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-typogrify/" title="wp-typogrify plugin for WordPress">wp-typogrify</a> (or similar).

Many of the presentations have been made available online at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tag/barcampcanberra" title="Slideshare homepage">Slideshare</a>. Flickr now features <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/barcampcanberra/pool/" title="flickr barcampcanberra tag pool">a good hundred great photos</a> of the event. We also greatly utilized <a href="http://twitter.com/barcampcanberra" title="Twitter BarCampCanberra profile">a Twitter stream</a> during the event to post updates and status of presentations as well as links mentioned in talks. Audio and video of the talks is coming online slowly&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;see the <a href="http://barcampcanberra.org/blog/podcasts/" title="BarCampCanberra audio">BarCampCanberra blog</a>.

The event was completely sponsored by both local companies and ones further abroad&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;thanks kindly to acidlabs, Web Directions, SMS Management & Technology, AussieHQ, Microsoft, Indigo Pacific, Maadmob and Kate Carruthers. This meant stomachs were kept at bay during the day, throats never got too dry and at the end of it all the &rsquo;campers could chat excitedly over a pint or glass of wine.

A special mention should also go out to AussieHQ who fed thirty two of us at the end of the day at the Turkish Pide House. Thanks guys.

Overall a great turnout for a place like Canberra. It was a great success and I'm very happy to have seen <abbr>BCC1</abbr> run before I leave for Europe.
