title: Write for your readers
---

Jeffrey Zeldman just published <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2009/08/09/write-when-inspired/" title="zeldman.com: Write When Inspired">a brief article on writing</a> that is well worth a read. Although its prime focus is doing it well by realising that you write best whilst inspired, ensuring you give yourself apt breaks&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;&ldquo;<em>write when inspired; rest when tired</em>&rdquo; is his mnemonic&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;I particularly took a liking to his second last closing paragraph:

<blockquote cite="Jeffrey Zeldman">
    <p>Never mind the bollocks. You are not writing for Amazon, or to fit a staff proofreader&rsquo;s vacation schedule, as important and real as those considerations may be. You are writing for readers, a duty as sacred, in its way, as parenting. If you don&rsquo;t believe the previous sentence, if you think writing is mainly about getting paid, I&rsquo;m sorry you wasted your time reading this page, and I hope you find another way to earn a living soon. The world is already choking on half-considered, squeezed-out shit. There&rsquo;s no need to add to the pile.</p>
</blockquote>

Perfectly sums up my feelings on the matter.
