I worked with Waugh Partners on the report producing their bar and pie graphs over the last few months. The work was done entirely using open source toolsâ€”namely Inkscape and Scribus. Working with Waugh Partners was a sincere pleasure: I was actively encouraged to use open source tools and of course got to have a sneak peak at the report.
