About a month now ago I began a podcast with the esteemed [Andy White](http://arcwhite.org), focusing on the developments and whatnot of the web and tech scene from a web developer, designer and entrepreneurial perspective. The show, titled <em>A Capital Duo Talk Tech</em> now needs renaming as we bring on our third panellist, [Teresa Watts](http://teresawatts.com).

Rather than going into further detail on the show and [previous episodes](http://arcwhite.org/category/podcasts/), <a href="http://arcwhite.org/2009/08/20/a-capital-trio-talk-tech-episode-four-no-silly-voice/" title="Download, stream, and/or subscribe to the show over at Andy&rsquo;s website">I&rsquo;ll let the fourth episode do the talking</a>.

#### Show synopsis

We bring you episode four, where we welcome our third panellist, who shall be joining us in the future! After discussing [Teresa's awesome hand-made <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> voodoo doll](http://www.chigarden.com/2007/10/tutorial-making-the-ie-voodoo-doll/) we move onto a good chat about our business endeavours and employment experiences. We cover Andy's business and his lessons learned since closing it end 2008 (focus, cash-flow and buffer savings, the pros and cons of outsourcing, dedicated working positions) before moving onto Teresa's and Pascal's experiences in in-house and freelance positions. Issues here include focus and structure but restrictive and limiting in manner, becoming bored by working on the same thing long-term, though however how it was a good experience&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we both learned what we did and didn't like doing.

Finally we all shed our wisdom on the lifestyle that is freelancing. Here we go over the ability to vet clients (yay!), communicating with clients, the importance of networking and being actively involved in your industry's community (Twitter, LinkedIn, <acronym title="Special Interest Group">SIG</acronym>s, conferences, speaking, ...), pricing, separating work environment from the rest of your living space, and having an active web presence. Oh, and as usual Pascal makes a fool of himself, but nicely gets a stab back at Andy.

We've got interviews confirmed with Donna Benjamin on open education and Ian Cairns of Development Seed on Open Atrium&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;stay tuned. On that note actually, Pascal has set up Open Atrium on <a href="http://open.klepas.org" title="Pascal&rsquo; Open Atrium instance">open.klepas.org</a> and has a guest testing group set up. Email or <a href="http://twitter.com/klepas" title="Pascal&rsquo; Twitter profile">@ him on Twitter</a> to get an account and have a play.

Recorded post-show, this week's 'fuck you of the week' goes to Apple for it's failings in saving and syncing voice recordings via the Voice Memo app properly and 'the tip of the cap' goes to Teresa for her <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> voodoo doll&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;seriously, check it out!
